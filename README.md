# AntonFriberg's Dotfiles

My personal configuration files and scripts used under both Arch Linux, Ubuntu
and Debian machines. Currently running [i3-gaps] window manager with [polybar],
[rofi] application launcher, [urxvt] terminal and [compton] as compositor

Based on the [nord colorscheme] and managed by [yadm].

## Dotfile Installation & Management

### History

I previously used a simple solution to keep my dotfiles under version control
which I found on the [Atlassian developer blog]. This technique is great since according to comments requires:

> No extra tooling, no symlinks, files are tracked on a version control system,
  you can use different branches for different computers, you can replicate you configuration easily on new installation.

However, recently I found [yadm], Yet Another Dotfiles Manager, which embraces
the same underlying idea but adds a user-friendly interface.
